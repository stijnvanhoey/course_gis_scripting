# Setup

Make sure your have `rgdal`, `rgeos`, `raster`, `ggmap`, `leaflet` and `sp` installed:

```{r install, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
install.packages(c("rgdal", "rgeos", "raster", "ggmap", "leaflet", "sp"))
```

```{r load, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library('rgdal')
library('sp')
library('raster')
library('rgeos')
library('leaflet')
library('ggmap')
```

# Spatial (vector) data objects: `sp`

Package `sp` is the central package supporting spatial data analysis in R. `sp` defines a set of classes to represent spatial data. A class defines a particular data type. The `data.frame` is an example of a class. Any particular data.frame you create is an **object** (instance) of that class.

In fact, the `sp` package does not provide many functions to modify or analyse spatial data; but the classes it defines are used in >100 other R packages that provide specific functionalities. The classes `sp` defines are mostly starting with `Spatial*`. For vector data, the basic types are the `SpatialPoints`, `SpatialLines`, and `SpatialPolygons`. These classes only represent **geometries** (i.e. the spatial information). To link the spatial information to a data-table, classes are available with these names plus `DataFrame`, for example, `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` and `SpatialPointsDataFrame`.

## Geometries

Consider the following vectors with coordinate information:
```{r intro_data}
longitude <- c(4.4543, 5.02789, 4.94202, 4.49238, 4.49054, 4.54044, 5.95192, 
               4.49496, 4.4958, 5.68327, 4.49054, 4.49054, 4.4958, 4.48938)
latitude <- c(51.33847, 51.24824, 51.24325, 51.26218, 51.25701, 51.27518, 
              51.30803, 51.25803, 51.26106, 51.04185, 51.25701, 51.25701, 
              51.26106, 51.25955)
lonlat <- cbind(longitude, latitude)
```

Besides the numbers itself, the variable `lonlat` is not aware of any spatial context (it is just a `matrix` object). 

```{r intro_spatialload}
pts <- SpatialPoints(lonlat)
class(pts)
```

We converted the vector to an object of `SpatialPoints`, which contains, beside the matrix data, additional information:

```{r intro_show}
showDefault(pts)
```

So we see that the object has the coordinates we supplied, but also a `bbox`. This is a ‘bounding box’, or the ‘spatial extent’ that was computed from the coordinates. There is also a `proj4string`. This stores the coordinate reference system (CRS). We did not provide the crs so it is unknown (NA). That is not good, so let’s recreate the object, and now provide a crs. We'll come back to the projection definition later:

```{r intro_setcrs}
crs_wgs84 <- CRS("+init=epsg:4326")
pts <- SpatialPoints(lonlat, proj4string = crs_wgs84)
showDefault(pts)
```

Hence, the projection information is provided and our geometry is aware of the spatial context. 

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<h4>REMEMBER:</h4>

Assigning a CRS is like labeling something. You need to provide the label that corresponds to the item. Not to what you would like it to be. The latter requires a transformation.
</div>


The definition of the geometry as an object of the `SpatialPoints` class, provides a number of spatial functionalities that are not directly available to *default* matrices. As said in the introduction, the `sp` class mainly focuses on the classes (objects) and not on the functionalities. However, an essential functionality provided by `sp` itself (apart from `over` and `aggregate`), is the **transformation of the coordinate reference system (CRS)**:

```{r intro_transform}
crs_lambert <- CRS("+init=epsg:31370") 
pts_lambert <- spTransform(pts, crs_lambert)
showDefault(pts_lambert)
```

Other (geometric) operations are provided by (a huge amount of) additional R Packages. The `rgeos` package is an important package to check for these functionalities. As an example: adding a buffer to our `SpatialPoints` object:
```{r intro_buffer}
# gbuffer from the rgeos package (see later)
pts_lambert_buffer <- gBuffer(pts_lambert, byid = TRUE, width = 2000) 
```

Hence, the result is again a `Spatial*` object, i.e. a `SpatialPolygons` object. A plot of the `pts_lambert` and the `pts_lambert_buffered` together looks as follows:

```{r intro_plotstatic}
plot(pts_lambert_buffer, border = 'blue', 
     col = 'yellow', lwd = 3, axes = TRUE)
plot(pts_lambert, add = TRUE, col = 'red', las = 1)
```

For quick data exploration of such a small data set, an interactive visualization provides better insight. The [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) package is well-documented and easy to use, certainly when the `dplyr` piping is familiar to use:

```{r intro_plotinteract}
wgs_84 <- CRS("+init=epsg:4326")
leaflet() %>%  
    addTiles() %>%  # provide a default openstreetmap background layer to the image
    addCircles(data = pts)  %>% # Add the points to the map
    addPolygons(data = spTransform(pts_lambert_buffer, wgs_84)) # Add the buffer polygons to the map
```


<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>

Check the [documentation of the leaflet Package](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) and adapt the following items to the leaflet map:<br>
(1) The coordinates should be replaced by an icon marker instead of just a circle<br>
(2) The buffers should not be filled and have a red color.
</div>

The output should look like:
```{r exercise1, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
```

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
<h4>Notice:</h4>

You can add any available WMS service to the map, by using the proper links to the WMS service. Examples are provided in [this tutorial](https://inbo-tutorials.netlify.com/spatial/wms/).
</div>


## Spatial***DataFrame

The geometry classes provided by `sp` contain the spatial information, but do not add data to these points (or lines/polygons). The data attribute table is typically provided as a `data.frame`. For this reason, `sp` also provides classes that link the geometries with DataFrames: `SpatialPointsDataFrame`, `SpatialLinesDataFrame` and `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`. 

Let's assume that for each of the coordinates defined above, we also have information about an `identifier` and a `scientificName`:

```{r sp_create_data}
identifiers <- c('INBO:NBN:BFN00179000029DL', 'INBO:NBN:BFN001790000A584', 
                 'INBO:NBN:BFN001790000AACI', 'INBO:NBN:BFN0017900009DOC', 
                 'INBO:NBN:BFN001790000A4J0', 'INBO:NBN:BFN0017900009DO8', 
                 'INBO:NBN:BFN001790000AACF', 'INBO:NBN:BFN001790000A4JO', 
                 'INBO:NBN:BFN001790000A4K8', 'INBO:NBN:BFN001790000A51G', 
                 'INBO:NBN:BFN001790000A4J3', 'INBO:NBN:BFN001790000A4J5', 
                 'INBO:NBN:BFN001790000A4K6', 'INBO:NBN:BFN001790000A4L5')
scientific_names <- c('Lagarosiphon major', 'Lagarosiphon major', 
                      'Muntiacus reevesii', 'Muntiacus reevesii', 
                      'Muntiacus reevesii', 'Muntiacus reevesii', 
                      'Muntiacus reevesii', 'Muntiacus reevesii', 
                      'Muntiacus reevesii', 'Muntiacus reevesii', 
                      'Muntiacus reevesii', 'Muntiacus reevesii', 
                      'Muntiacus reevesii', 'Muntiacus reevesii')
recorded <- as.data.frame(cbind(identifiers, scientific_names))
head(recorded)
```

Hence, the `SpatialPointsDataFrame` combines the spatial information (`pts_lambert`) with the recorded data (`recorded`):

```{r sp_create_df}
pts_recorded <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(pts_lambert, data = recorded)
pts_recorded
```

For the moment, the take home message is that `Spatial***DataFrame` bring together the attribute data (`data.frame`), the coordinates (`geometry`) and the coordinate reference system (`crs`): 

```{r sp_data_attrib}
head(pts_recorded@data)
```

```{r sp_coord_attrib}
head(pts_recorded@coords)
```

```{r sp_proj_attrib}
pts_recorded@proj4string
```

## Projection

In the previous section, we already used the `CRS` class definition to specify the coordinate reference system. As many other systems, R uses the [PROJ.4](http://proj4.org/) notation to define the CRS. The number of parameters depends on the projection. However, the easiest way is (mostly) using the [`EPSG` code](http://spatialreference.org/), for example:

```{r proj_epsg, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
CRS("+init=epsg:4326")
CRS("+init=epsg:31370")
```

But other options are available as well:

```{r proj_utm}
CRS("+proj=utm +zone=32")
```

In general, the definition of the CRS (input argument) should ba a string setup up by one or more `+<arg>=<value>` combinations, each of them separated by a blank value: `+<arg1>=<value1> +<arg2>=<value2>`. The CRS-creation returns an object (with a variable name you can assign):
```{r proj_objects}
wgs_84 <- CRS("+init=epsg:4326")
wgs_lambert <- CRS("+init=epsg:31370")
wgs_84
wgs_lambert
```

which can be used in other functions/methods or used to **support the transformation of the coordinate reference system** of *spatial aware objects*. Hence, transformation won't work on a default vector or matrix object:

```{r proj_transf_fail, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
sp::spTransform(c(98710.32800000161, 162573.7030000016), wgs_84)
```

But after transformation of the single coordinate to a `SpatialPoints` object, the `spTransform` function can be used:
```{r proj_transf_point}
single_coordinate <- SpatialPoints(matrix(c(98710.32800000161, 
                                            162573.7030000016), 
                                          ncol = 2), 
                                   proj4string = wgs_lambert)
                                  
spTransform(single_coordinate, wgs_84)
```

The application is similar to other spatial objects, such as a `SpatialPointsDataFrame`:
```{r proj_transf_df}
pts_recorded_wgs84 <- spTransform(pts_recorded, wgs_84)
pts_recorded_wgs84
```

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>

As your regularly encounter point coordinates that need conversion to another projection system, you decide to make a functions for future use:<br>

For any `data.frame`(!) with coordinate information in a known coordinate reference system, update the columns with the x/y information to another coordinate system. The function returns the updated `data.frame`.

The function will probably look more or less like this:<br><br>

    reproject_points <- function(df, col_long, col_lat,
                                 project_input, project_output){
        # ...
        
        return(df)
</div>

```{r exercise2, include=FALSE}
```

Following test should be able to work with the `reproject_points` function:
```{r proj_ex_test, message=FALSE}
pts_ex2_test <- as.data.frame(pts_recorded)
ex2_test <- reproject_points(pts_ex2_test, "longitude", "latitude",
                             CRS("+init=epsg:31370"), 
                             CRS("+init=epsg:4326"))
head(ex2_test)
```

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
<h4>Notice:</h4>

This `reproject_points` function is part of the [`inborutil` package, ](https://inbo.github.io/inborutils/reference/reproject_coordinates.html) as the function `reproject_coordinates` and can be used after installing the `inborutils` package: `devtools::install_github("inbo/inborutils")`.
</div>


# Reading data: `rgdal`

Mostly, the starting point of a data analysis involving spatial data is a data set in any kind of GIS format. The functionality to read **vector** data is provide by the `readOGR` function or the `rgdal` package:

```{r read_shape}
deelbekkens <- readOGR("../data/deelbekkens/Deelbekken.shp")
```

```{r read_show_shape}
deelbekkens
```

```{r read_plot_object}
plot(deelbekkens)
```

Besides shapefiles, other vector data formats can be read as well. Certainly `geojson` is a increasingly used data format for feature (vector) data sets:

```{r read_geojson}
eu_10grid <- readOGR("../data/EUgrid10.geojson")
```
```{r read_show_geojson}
eu_10grid
```

Actually, the set of data formats you can interact with, *does not depend on R*, but is dependent on your GDAL installation. To check if the installation supports a specific **vector** data format, you can get an overview of them by the `ogrDrivers()` command:

```{r read_show_drivers}
head(ogrDrivers()) # Just the first 6 records are shown here
```

For data sets with multiple layers, the reading of a specific Layer is supported as well. For example, when the driver to read ESRI FileGeoDatabases is present, following commands will be useful as well:

```{r read_gdb_example, eval=FALSE}
# Information about the data (without actually reading the data itself)
ogrInfo(dsn = "name_filegeodatabase.gdb") 
# List the names of the layers in the dataset
ogrListLayers(dsn = "name_filegeodatabase.gdb")
# Reading a specific layer
readOGR(dsn = "name_filegeodatabase.gdb", layer = "layer_of_interest")
```

# Vector data manipulation

## DataFrame alike manipulation

Vector data represented as `Spatial***DataFrame` can be sub selected as a DataFrame. For example, selecting only the `deelbekkens` that are in the `Netebekken` (Boolean indexing):

```{r man_subset}
nete <- deelbekkens[deelbekkens$BEKNAAM == "Netebekken", ]
plot(nete)
```

The result of the selection is again a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`. When only interested in the data itself, the selection of the attribute data alone can be done by converting the data to a DataFrame. 

```{r man_subset_show}
head(as.data.frame(nete))
```

Hence, the geometry and projection data is no longer contained, only the data itself.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<h4>REMEMBER:</h4>

The `sp` data types do NOT support the `dplyr` package. If you want to use the `%>%` operator and the *verbs* such as `filter`, `mutate`,... as used in the `dplyr` package, you could start using the [`sf` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html), the newest package setup with the `tidyverse` environment in mind. [This introduction](http://strimas.com/r/tidy-sf/) and the [documentation of](https://github.com/edzer/sfr) of `sf` is good to start.
</div>


## `sp` overlay and aggregations

The `sp` package provides mostly the data types. However, the `spTransform` function is an essential function provided by the package itself. Two other functions of the `sp` package are worth mentioning:

*  `disaggregate`: groups of `Line` or `Polygon` (multi) are disaggregated to one `Line`/`Polygon` for each feature. When applied to the `deelbekkens` data set:

```{r sp_disaggreg}
length(deelbekkens)
deelbekkens_disaggr <- disaggregate(deelbekkens)
length(deelbekkens_disaggr)
```
The number of features increases, as each polygon in the data set is now defined as an individual feature of the data set.

* `over(x, y)` is used for spatial JOINs 

```{r over_join}
ids <- over(spTransform(eu_10grid, wgs_lambert), pts_recorded)
ids <- na.omit(ids)
ids
```
The result provides the indices of the `SpatialPolygonDataFrame` together with the `SpatialPointDataFrame` data entries. `Lines`, and `Polygon`-`Polygon` overlays require `rgeos`.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
<h4>Notice:</h4>

Check the vignette (`vignette('over')` in console) to get more details about all the different spatial JOIN options with the `sp` package. On the other hand, the `sf` package interface for spatial joins is more intuitive. This [point-in-polygon example](https://gist.github.com/stijnvanhoey/7b51017718834f150f781a256292904e#file-spatial_join-r) compares the `sp` and the `sf` implementation. 
</div>


## `rgeos` geometry operations

The `rgeos` package provide a number of geometric operations, such as `gArea()`, `gLength()`, `gDistance()`, `gBuffer()`,... (single geometry) or `gIntersection()`, `gUnion()`, `gContains`,... (combining geometries). 

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
<h4>Notice:</h4>

As most commands of rgeos start with g***, use the power of the TAB-button to explore the available functions of the `rgeos` package: `rgeos::g` + TAB
</div>

These functions operate both on `Spatial*` objects (see above) as well as `Spatial***DataFrame` objects. Most of these functions speak for themselves (or read the manual). An important argument of these functions is `byid`. The `byid` argument determines if the function should be applied across sub geometries (`TRUE`) or the entire object (`FALSE`). Default is `FALSE`. For example, for the `area` calculation:

```{r man_area}
gArea(nete) # default is FALSE -> entire object
```
versus
```{r man_area_byid}
gArea(nete, byid = TRUE)
```

Comparison of geometries involves two geometries:

```{r man_contains}
vertical <- eu_10grid[grep('E400', eu_10grid$CellCode), ]
horizontal <- eu_10grid[grep('N311', eu_10grid$CellCode), ]

comparison <- gContains(vertical, horizontal, 
                        byid = TRUE, checkValidity = TRUE, 
                        returnDense = TRUE) # Test also with gIntersects
true_ids <- as.data.frame(which(comparison, arr.ind = TRUE)) # Find the TRUE elements
true_ids
```

```{r man_contains_plot}
# adjusting the colors transparency
blue <- adjustcolor("blue", alpha.f = 0.3) 
red <- adjustcolor("darkred", alpha.f = 0.3) 

# plot the cells selected by the geometry comparison:
plot(vertical)
plot(vertical[true_ids$col,], add = TRUE, col = blue)
plot(horizontal, add = TRUE)
plot(horizontal[true_ids$row,], add = TRUE, col = red)
```

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>

Make a `leaflet` plot (with open street map background) of the `nete` sub catchments, together with the `Centroid` for each of the sub geometries.

<b>Tip 1:</b> Looking for a command that matches the action `centroid` in R, is done by using `??centroid` in the Console.<br>
<b>Tip 2:</b> Remember that leaflet always expects WGS84 as CRS to make a plot(!)
</div>

The output should look like:
```{r exercise3, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
```

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
<h4>Notice:</h4>

It is not always needed to download both data sets and do the spatial operation on your own machine. Some WFS Webservices (providing maps online) support spatial operators such as within, intersects, contains,... directly. As such, the point in polygon problem can be tackled directly as explained in the tutorial ['download feature attributes from WFS'](https://inbo-tutorials.netlify.com/spatial/wfs/).
</div>

# Mapping vector data

## `ggplot`

When working with DataFrame data, the application of `ggplot2` is typical. Hence, it would be convenient to use `ggplot2` (and the syntax) to plot `Spatial***DataFrame` as well. As `ggplot2` only works on `data.frame` objects, a translation need to be made between the `Spatial***DataFrame` and a default `data.frame`. 

For `SpatialPointsDataFrame` this is not really an issue, as the `longitude` and `latitude` columns provide the geometry information and can be used as such in `ggplot` by directly converting the data to a `data.fram`

```{r plot_point_df}
pts_recorded_df <- as.data.frame(pts_recorded)
pts_recorded_df
```

```{r plot_point_plot}
ggplot(pts_recorded_df, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_text(size = 4, aes(label = scientific_names), 
              check_overlap = TRUE, hjust = -0.1) +
    xlim(150000, 300000)
```

For `Lines` and `Polygons`, the translation requires an entire interpretation of the configuration towards a `data.frame`. This functionality is provided by `fortify`, which translates the **spatial** information:

```{r plot_df_geom, message=FALSE}
nete_df <- fortify(nete)
head(nete_df)
```

```{r plot_df_geom_show}
class(nete_df)
```

The individual columns of the resulting `data.frame` describe the following elements:

* `long` and `lat`: x and y coordinates
* `order`: sequence of the polygones or lines
* `hole`: identifies whether the feature the coordinates are part of define a hole
* `piece`: collects all the points that make a single feature (polygon/line), i.e. 1 attributes table line
• `group`: defines the subpolygons or sublines (in case of multipolygon/multiline features)
• `id`: row identifiers of the attribute table (data)

Still, the added value of using `ggplot2` is to use the attribute data to define colors,... As the attribute data table is available and we have an identifier `id`, we can JOIN the attribute data to the spatial information after retrieving the **attribute** data with the `as.data.frame` function:

```{r plot_df_attr}
nete_df <- merge(nete_df, as.data.frame(nete))
head(nete_df)
```

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<h4>REMEMBER:</h4>

In order to plot `SpatialLinesDataFrame` or `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` data, the **spatial data** (with `fortify()`) need to be merged with the **attribute data** (with `as.data.frame`) to have a `ggplot2` compatible `data.frame`!
</div>

This seems to be a useful small tooling for a custom R function...

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>

Write a function called `prepare_spatial_for_ggplot` that takes a `SpatialLinesDataFrame` or `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` as input and execute the necessary steps (described above: `fortify`/`as.data.frame`/`merge`) to enable the plotting with `ggplot2`. The output of the function is a `data.frame`.
</div>

```{r exercise4, include=FALSE}
```

Following test should be able to work with the `prepare_spatial_for_ggplot` function:
```{r plot_ex_test, message=FALSE}
ex4_test <- prepare_spatial_for_ggplot(nete)
head(ex4_test)
```

For plotting `Lines`, use the `ggplot` function `geom_path()` (and NOT `geom_line()`). For polygons, you can choose:
* `geom_path()`: only plot the borders
* `geom_polygon()`: usa a fill color for the polygons

```{r plot_polygon_plot}
ggplot(nete_df, aes(x = long, y = lat)) +
    geom_polygon(aes(group = group, fill = id)) +
    coord_fixed()
```

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<h4>REMEMBER:</h4>

Adding `group = group` (grouping according to the by fortify derived groups) is required to plot the individual polygons separately(!)
</div>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
<h4>Notice:</h4>

Starting from ggplot2 version 2.2.1, the plotting of spatial objects defined in the `sf` package will no longer need this transformation, but will directly provide the `geom_sf` function to plot vector data in `ggplot2`, see [the documentation](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html)! 
</div>

## `ggmap`

The `ggmap` package is the spatial plotting extension to `ggplot2`. It provides the ability to integrate the graphs of `ggplot2` with spatial backgrounds coming from online resources such as Google maps, [stamen maps](http://maps.stamen.com/#terrain/12/37.7706/-122.3782) and OpenStreetMap. The most convenient way to setup these background maps is to use the `ggmap::get_***` functions. For example, using the `toner-background` of stamen:

```{r plot_ggmap_toner, message=FALSE}
extent <- c(left = 2.54, bottom = 49.46, right = 6.4, top = 51.51)
map <- get_stamenmap(extent, zoom = 8, maptype = "toner-background")
belgium <- ggmap(map)
belgium
```

Just as with the OpenStreetMap integration of the `leaflet` package, these spatial background coming from online resources use `WGS84` (decimal degrees). Make sure to convert the vector data to the WGS84 `CRS`:

```{r plot_ggmap_toner_nete, message=FALSE}
nete_wgs84 <- spTransform(nete, wgs_84)
nete_df_wgs84 <- fortify(nete_wgs84)
nete_df_wgs84 <- merge(nete_df_wgs84, as.data.frame(nete_wgs84))
    
belgium +
    geom_path(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
          data = nete_df_wgs84, colour = "red")
```

The `bbox` can be defined more specifically to improve the boundaries of the background image. Focusing on the Nete catchment:

```{r plot_ggmap_toner_zoom, message=FALSE}
extent <- c(left = 4.42, bottom = 50.9, right = 5.4, top = 51.4)
map <- get_stamenmap(bbox = extent, zoom = 10, maptype = "toner-hybrid")
ggmap(map) + 
    geom_path(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
              data = nete_df_wgs84, colour = "red")
```

<h4>Notice:</h4>

Each of these online providers have different `maptype` options. Check the help of these functions to see the options (e.g. `?get_stamenmap`).

The usage of Google maps enables the option to provide a *google maps search* as center of the image
```{r plot_ggmap_google, message=FALSE}
map <- get_googlemap(center = "Geel Belgium",  scale = 2, 
                     maptype = "terrain", zoom = 9)
ggmap(map) +
    geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = id, alpha = 0.5), 
          data = nete_df_wgs84, colour = "white")
```

The [Github repository](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap) and [the paper](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013-1/kahle-wickham.pdf) provide more introductionary material to get you started with `ggmap`. Another potentially useful plotting package is the [`tmap`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-nutshell.html) package.

<h4>Exercise:</h4>

Pick **any spatial vector** data set (shapefile, geojson,...) currently on your computer:

(1) `read` the file into R as a Spatial***DataFrame
(2) make a subselection of the dataset using one of the data columns and a condition (e.g. `length  > 10000`)
(3) create a `ggplot` with the color of each spatial entity defined by a chosen data columns
